# Assignment 1 - Topic Modeling 

By analyzing academic journals, we can see what scholars have been interested in studying over time. A prime example is the work of Goldstone and Underwood on the PMLA, which we are reading for class. The goal of this assignment to apply a particular text analysis method - topic modeling - to provide a "distant reading"/ "macroanalysis" of a scholarly journal.  The assingment has two components: (1) topic modeling interactive visualizaiton and (2) a reflection piece on the method and what you can learn about the journal using text analysis.  The final assignment should be a markdown file in your repository: https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-YOURUSERNAME 

Each person must do a different academic journal. Please email me once you have selected a journal. I will upate the list here: 

| Name | Journal |
|-------|---------|
| Dr. Tilton | American Quaterly | 
| Amanda Corbosiero | Discourse Studies | 
| Kobi White | Journal of African American Studies|  
| Emily Song |  The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|
| Kristi Mukk | The American Archivist | 
| Kylie Britt | The Slavivonic & Eastern European Review | 
| Matt Fichera |  Journal of Financial Education | 
| Alexis Williams | Gender and Development |
| Luke Malcynsky | The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | 
| Sal Girma | Afro-Hispanic Review |
| Raven Baugh | The American Poetry Review| 



A note about collaboration:   You may work with each to help get the code working and to build your interactive visualization. You MAY NOT work with each other on the reflection. This should be your interpretation of the course readings and discussions as applied to your particular scholarly journal. 

## Corpus / Data

### Jstor
[JStor Data for Research (DFR)](http://about.jstor.org/service/data-for-research) provides machine-readable data from JStor, 
a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources.


### Downloading Data

It takes several days for Jstor to send the data. Make sure to make this request immediately. 
The main page for Jstor DFR is [here](http://dfr.jstor.org).  Set up an account [here](https://www.jstor.org/register?redirectUri=/dfr/results) and select your data [here](https://www.jstor.org/dfr/results).  To select a particular journal, [here are the instructions](https://www.jstor.org/dfr/about/creating-datasets?loggedin=true&facet_journal=am91cm5hbA%3D%3D&ed=&searchType=facetSearch&Query=american+quarterly&page=1&sd=). 
One you have selected a journal, make sure there are at least 500 records to use; otherwise, 
we can't use topic modeling as there aren't enough records. There are two more categories to consider:

- Article Type: Pick the kind of articles you'd like to analyze. 
For example, one might only be interested in research articles or just book reviews. You can also do them all! 

- Year of Publication: You might consider just looking at a journal during a specific period. For example, did *American Quarterly* (the journal of  the field of American Studies) look at specific topics during the 1960s in the middle of the U.S. social movements?


Select All of the Data Types.  

If the data has more than 25,000 documents, there are two options. 
You can make several requests to capture all the data or you need to select a subset. 
If you do not, you will get a random generated subset from JStor. Do *not* use a random subset.

The final assignment is comprised of two components:

1. Topic Modeling Visualization
2. Written Response 


------------------

### Topic Modeling Visualization

Using an adapted version of the [Signs@40 interface](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/), build a site that visualizes your corpus. 
The corpus is an academic journal of your choice. The data should come from JSTOR's Data For Research (info below). 

The information for how to build the interface is available [here](https://github.com/statsmaths/dh-topic-models). Make sure to give descriptive names for the topics. 

Make sure to include a link to your site in your written response. It should be https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/dh-topic-models.


### Written Response

The 500-1500 word response should explain the data set, the initial findings, 
and how one would go about further exploring the data set/ findings/ arguments. 
It should  also address the following questions:

- What is the scope of the journal?
- What question(s) are you trying to answer?
- Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specificy the kind of data and periodization. 
- Why the number of topics? 
- What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?
- Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?


More details:

- Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). 

- Save as "assignment2_YOURLASTNAME.md" in your repository (https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-YOURUSENAME). 

- Grading: [Rubric](https://github.com/nolauren/dh2017/blob/master/assignment2_rubric.pdf)
