# Network Analysis Assignment 


## Part 1: Network
Build your network in R using [Network Lab I](https://github.com/nolauren/2018introdh/blob/master/lab06_network1.md) 
and/or Network Lab II. Save images of your networks to include in your paper. 
You will need to use screenshot - [Mac](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-on-a-Mac) 
and [Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-in-Microsoft-Windows). Make sure the images include 
at least a reference to one case like the img below:

To link to your images in your Paper, you can save the images in Github. To do this by uploading the images to your Github. 
I have already created a folder in your reposistory called 'images'. 


## Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.
- Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data.
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, 
discuss the possibilitie and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for 
network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers. 

## Data

You can build your own data set or use the Supreme Court data. 

### Supreme Court

In order to indentify areas of that law that cases address, 
Washington University in St. Louis assigned each United States Supreme Court case to a legal issue (ex. desegregation). 
The [code book](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?s=1) lists the corresponding 
issue assigned [each issue number in the data set](https://github.com/introdh2016/response3_network/blob/master/ussc-31.zip). 
Our data has most of the code but not all. [Use this list](https://github.com/nolauren/2018introdh/blob/master/lab06_network1_scotus_issue_codes.csv) to decide which cases to analyze. 
In order to better understand this Supreme Court data, 
read [Fowler and Jean, The Authority of Supreme Court Precendent](https://github.com/nolauren/dh2017/blob/master/authority_of_supreme_court_precedent.pdf).

For the supreme court data, we are  looking at co-citation networks, 
which means two cases are connected by an edge if 5 or more cases cite the cases together. 
We do this because otherwise the network will overrepresent cases that include a lot of citations. 

The netowrk must compare at least 2 sets of casses. 
Make sure in the paper to explain why you picked the cases that are being comparing. 

If you choose to work with Supreme Court data, you must send me the cases 
and cannot use the same cases as another member of the course.

### Your Data

Want to use your own data? Go for it! 
See Network 2 Lab for instructions on how to build your data set.
Please create the data in google sheets and include the link in your paper. 


## More details:

- Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012).

- Images: Include images of networks. There should be an image for each plot type (all 6 types) if you use the Supreme Court Data. If you use your own data, there should at least be an image of plots 1-5.

- Save as "assignment2_YOURLASTNAME.md" in your repository: https://github.com/introdh/YOURUSERNAME
