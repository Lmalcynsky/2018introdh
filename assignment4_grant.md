# Final Grant and Presentation

The final assignment is creating an NEH ODH Advancement Grant. Goals include:

- Developing a DH project that poses and answers humanities questions.
- Articulating which methods are appropriate for the object of study. 
- Explaining a DH project in a way that is understandable to a general audience.
- Becoming familiar with how grants work and how to write one.

We will be using the 2019 NEH ODH Advancement Grant application as our guide.
Your DH grant should include 
[the sections marked in green](https://github.com/nolauren/2018introdh/blob/master/finalgrant.pdf). 
You may work in groups of 2 or by yourself. 

In preparation, we will have an [in-class grant workshop on 11-19](https://github.com/nolauren/2018introdh/blob/master/lab10_grantworkshop.md).
It includes instructions for how to prepare for the workshop, which includes posting an abstract. 

The final grant is due 12-13. It should be submitted in your repository and named "finalgrant_YOURLASTNAME.md".

Along with submitting the grant, each group will pitch their project to the class on 12-3. 
Sign-up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZLt54GigU9prI0jdyIo7S08O-LZ1KqnOQkBstKMIMHs/edit?usp=sharing).
Each person will be a member of the selection committee and we will vote to fund 2 grants. Details below!
