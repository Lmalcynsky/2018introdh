# Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to use "representations of space" to communicate your "spatial practices" at UR. 

## Part 1
Build and map a custom data set about your activies over the course of week. 
- Build a dataset outling your activites over the course of a week. 
The data should track one week at UR from Monday, November 5 - Monday, November 12. You are welcome to add more days. 
- Map your movement over a week using ESRI ArcGIS Online from your spatial data. 


## Part 2

Develop a Storymap that narrates your relationship to "space" and "place" at UR. 
- At least 10 slides. 
- Include your ArcGIS Online map.
- At least five slides must use the Story Actions features.
- The Storymap should make a claim about your relationship to "space" and "place" at UR. 

## Part 3
Write a short reflection on the process that answers the following questions (500-1000 words):
- Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your Storymap.
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?
- Limits and possibilities of Mapping/ Spatial Analysis
- Include links to your data (google sheet) and StoryMap.
