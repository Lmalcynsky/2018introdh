# Network Analysis Assignment 

## Part 1: Network
Build your network in R using [Network Lab I](https://github.com/nolauren/2018introdh/blob/master/lab06_network1.md) 
and/or Network Lab II. Save images of your networks to include in your paper. 
You will need to use screenshot - [Mac](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-on-a-Mac) 
and [Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-in-Microsoft-Windows). Make sure the images include 
at least a reference to one case like the img below:

To link to your images in your Paper, you can save the images in Github. To do this by uploading the images to your Github. 
I have already created a folder in your reposistory called 'images'. 


## Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.
- Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data.
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, 
discuss the possibilitie and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for 
network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers. 
(Note: Failure to quote and cite the reading will result in a failing grade.)

## Data

You can build your own data set or use the Supreme Court data. 

### Supreme Court

Washington University in St. Louis assigned each United States Supreme Court case to a legal issue (ex. desegregation). 
Pick two or more issues and analyze.  The [code book](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?s=1) lists the corresponding 
issue assigned [each issue number in the data set](https://github.com/introdh2016/response3_network/blob/master/ussc-31.zip). 
In order to better understand this Supreme Court data, 
read [Fowler and Jean, The Authority of Supreme Court Precendent](https://github.com/nolauren/dh2017/blob/master/authority_of_supreme_court_precedent.pdf).

### Your Data

Want to use your own data? Go for it! 
See Network 2 Lab for instructions on how to build your data set.
Please create the data in google sheets and include the link in your paper. 


## More details:

- Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012).

- Images: Include images of your networks. 

- Save as "assignment2_YOURLASTNAME.md" in your repository: https://github.com/introdh/YOURUSERNAME
